# binPrimes

The algorithmic generation of Kyle Kneitinger's tattoo...also a generator of
prime numbers in stylized binary:

## Usage

To compile binPrimes simply run `g++ -o binprimes binPrimes.cpp`.
Without arguments, binPrimes generates the stylized output of the first 16 prime numbers: up to 53.  When a number is passed as an argument: `binprimes [n]`, binPrimes outputs up to the nth prime number.

### On Windows...

Out of curiosity, I compiled and ran binPrimes on my Windows 7 VM.  It runs a bit strange albeit, trippy.  It turns out that unicode on Windows is quite a hassle, and I am not very motivated to rewrite the majority of this program for an OS I only use when required for school assignments.  With that in mind, it still is quite interesting to look at on Windows...
